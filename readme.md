# GET STARTED

1. Install virtualenv , set it up, activate it. Remember to get the latest version.

2. Install latest version of pip.

3. pip3 install -r requirements.txt


##### Remember
Anytime we add more python dependencies that everyone's local machine will need to run, add it to the virtualenv
via pip install, then run : ```pip freeze > requirements.txt```
